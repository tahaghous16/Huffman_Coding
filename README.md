# üì¶ Huffman Coding - Text Compression in C++

This project demonstrates the **implementation of Huffman Coding**, a well-known algorithm for data compression. Huffman Coding works by assigning shorter binary codes to more frequent characters, thereby reducing the size of the text.

## üöÄ Features

- Calculate character frequencies
- Build a Huffman Tree using a min-heap
- Generate Huffman binary codes
- Encode the input text
- Display original vs. compressed size
- C++ implementation using only standard libraries

## üìñ About

This project was developed as part of the **Discrete Structures** course. It provides a practical demonstration of compression techniques using **binary trees**, **priority queues**, and **maps** in C++.

> ‚ÄúThe more a character appears, the shorter its binary code.‚Äù

## üîß How It Works

1. **User Input**: User enters a string to compress
2. **Frequency Calculation**: Map counts how often each character appears
3. **Min-Heap**: Priority queue arranges characters by frequency
4. **Huffman Tree**: Merge smallest frequencies into a binary tree
5. **Generate Codes**: Traverse the tree to assign binary codes
6. **Encode Text**: Convert text to compressed binary format
7. **Size Comparison**: Show original vs. compressed bit size

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

Through this project, I'm not only implemented Huffman Coding successfully but also deepened  understanding of how theoretical computer science concepts can solve real-world problems like data compression. It challenged  to think algorithmically, collaborate effectively, and write clean, modular C++ code.
What started as a course project turned into a meaningful learning experience ‚Äî showing how a few lines of binary can make a big difference in storage and performance. This project has motivated to continue exploring algorithms that power modern technology and to keep building solutions that are both efficient and elegant.
